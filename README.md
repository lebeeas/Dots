# Dots: Devices for One-handed Tying of Shoelaces

The Dots, short for Devices for One-handed Tying of Shoelaces, are a pair of small, 3D-printed gadgets you clip onto your shoelaces so you can fasten and unfasten them magnetically, without tying a traditional knot. 
They were created mainly to help people with limited hand or arm mobility, seniors who lack finger strength or dexterity, or anyone who finds it hard to bend over long enough to tie shoes (and anyone looking for a quicker, fuss-free alternative to regular laces).

Until now, the usual go-to has been shoes with Velcro straps or, in extreme cases, asking someone else to help each time you put your shoes on. The Dots offer an open-source solution that works with your existing footwear: everything from sneakers to dress shoes (there aren’t any convenient, ready-made alternatives on the market for those groups).

Each Dot consists of two main pieces: a “top” half and a “bottom” half that each attach to one lace. When you bring them together, the magnets snap them into place, letting you tighten or loosen your shoes, even with just one hand.

## Materials & Dimensions
Both halves were printed in PLA (polylactic acid), a plastic made mostly from the starchy sugars in plant seeds (think corn).

**Top half**

- Size: 27.6 × 27.6 × 4.5 mm
- Weight: ~2 g (excluding magnets, screw, washer and nut)
- Filament used: ~0.72 m

**Bottom half**

- Size: 27.6 × 27.6 × 4.0 mm
- Weight: ~2 g (without magnets)
- Filament used: ~0.65 m

**4 x Magnets**: 8.0 × 3.0 × 2.0 mm

**1 x Screw**: I didn’t understand how screw names work. This is the one I used:

> Not exactly a professional drawing. All measurements are in millimeters (mm).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The important thing is that the screw length equals the assembled device height (8 mm).

**1 x Nut**: Standard Hex Nut M3

**1 x Washer**: Flat, 3.0 mm inner diameter, 7.0 mm outer diameter

## Print Settings
- **Supports**: Yes (placed so magnet slots face up)
- **Layer** height: 0.2 mm
- **Infill**: 40%, Gyroid pattern

## Design Details
Each piece has a recess that guides the opposite lace into place when the magnets click together. The magnets sit visibly in their slots so you can drop them in after printing. This “industrial” look ensures compatibility with any printer: high-end or budget models (like mine). 
If you want a sleeker finish and can pause your printer mid-job, you could enclose the magnet slots in the model, stop to insert magnets, then resume printing to lock them in. 
I didn’t…just a bit of glue does the job perfectly :)
I avoided moving parts to simplify maintenance and maximize lifespan, even though hinges or clips might have looked fancier.

## How to Assemble One Device

### From the print bed → 
Remove both halves and clean off supports. You’ll find them in two spots: 
- The hex-shaped cavity on the upper half
- the rounded rectangular trough at the edge of each piece

### Put it together →

- Drop magnets into their slots. Orientation doesn’t matter on the first half; on the second, make sure the “flat” sides meet so the hidden-magnet faces nest together. A dab of glue keeps them from shifting.
- Place the nut in the hex slot, insert the washer and the screw from the opposite side, and tighten (no need to crank it down hard).
- You should now have these two finished halves:

### Mount on your shoes →

- Slip on the shoe and hold the device with its halves apart.
- Keep the laces threaded as usual but loose.
- Feed each lace end through the entry hole in its half.
- Snap the halves together, then pull the lace ends until the shoe feels snug—just like tying a knot.
- Tuck any excess lace by either:
  - Tying a small hidden knot near the exit hole and trimming the rest, or
  - Weaving the leftover length through the side eyelets like a stitch for a tidy look.

> [!WARNING]
> If you fit into one of the target groups, this last step might be tricky or impossible without help. I’m working on it. Sorry.

Repeat these steps for the other device that will go on the other shoe.

## A Few Tips
Don’t overtighten the screw. The nut simply keeps it from backing out, and once it’s flush with the plastic you’re all set.
Always let the halves meet on their flat faces so the magnets aren’t under constant pull, which could weaken their hold over time.

## Future Improvements

Add a small tab on each half to make unfastening easier—right now you have to grip the side of one piece, which can be tough for some.
Design a covering plate to hide the magnets for a cleaner look.
